// Problem 3: Minimum cost to connect ropes You are given an array of rope lengths. The cost of connecting two ropes is equal to the sum of their 
// lengths. The goal is to connect all ropes into one with minimum cost.

// Approach: Min Heap

// Input1: ropes (4,3,2,6)2 3 4 6

// Output1: 29

// 2+3 = 5

// 5+4 = 9 +5 = 14

// 9+6 15+14= 29

// Input2: ropes={1,2,5,10,35 89}

// Output2: 224
